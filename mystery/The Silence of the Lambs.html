                    The Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American psychological horror film directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Ted Tally, adapted from Thomas Harris's 1988 novel. It stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee who is hunting a serial
                    killer, "Buffalo Bill" (Ted Levine), who skins his female victims. To catch him, she seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. The film also
                    features performances from Scott Glenn, Anthony Heald, and Kasi Lemmons.

                    I watched this out of curiosity, no high expectations, I was just surprised to see Stallone in a tv series. You feel the tension in the scenes, it also feels fairly realistic as far as the plot would demand it. Wouldn't say it's humorous but a couple
                    funny scenes as a result of Dwight (Stallone) coming out of 25yr prison sentence and not fully integrated into the way the world works now; so I'm assuming the abrupt transition will offer some interesting hiccups for him down the
                    line for us. I'm glad someone told him how to use an Uber, it was funny while it lasted. It's a pretty smart script but not in a forcefully witty way which bodes well. Of course Stallone is a huge presence but the rest of the cast
                    seem pretty good.

                    I have loved Tulsa King so far. I actually love everything Taylor Sheridan does so I knew this would be no different. This is fun crime show that knows exactly what it wants to be and you can tell the cast, led by Sylvester Stallone, are all having a
                    blast making this. It's about a New York mafia boss named Dwight "The General" Manfredi (Stallone) who is released from prison after 25 years. He thinks he coming out to a hero's welcome but gets sent to Tulsa to run things instead.
                    After not feeling the love from his gang like he feels he should he starts to build his own in Tulsa. Some of it may come off as a little silly but overall it's a really good show that's definitely worth watching. It's obviously doing
                    well because it's already been renewed for a second season which is great news!
